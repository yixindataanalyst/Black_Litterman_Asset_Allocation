# Black_Litterman_Asset_Allocation
Black-Litterman (BL) is a popular portfolio optimization model that combines the views of an investor with a priori assumptions about expected returns to construct an optimal asset allocation. The BL model has several benefits over other asset allocation models, including:

**Incorporation of investor views:** The BL model allows investors to express their views on the expected returns of assets in their portfolio, which can improve the accuracy of asset allocation decisions.

**Reduced estimation error:** Traditional asset allocation models rely on estimates of expected returns, which can be subject to error due to estimation bias, sample size, or market volatility. The BL model uses a Bayesian approach to adjust expected returns based on the investor's views, which reduces estimation error.

**Improved diversification:** The BL model incorporates a diversified set of assets and takes into account their correlations, which can lead to more efficient and diversified portfolios.

**Flexibility:** The BL model is flexible in that it can be applied to any asset class, including equities, bonds, commodities, and alternative investments.

**Easy implementation:** The BL model is relatively easy to implement compared to other portfolio optimization models. With the help of software tools and online resources, investors can easily construct and manage a BL portfolio.

Overall, the BL model offers investors a more robust and flexible approach to asset allocation that takes into account their views, reduces estimation error, and improves diversification.

In this project, we selected 5 target stocks from the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges for asset allocation, and outputted the allocation proportions of our portfolio.
